Hi! My name is Aaron. My middle name is Yaoyang, which comes from my Chinese name 谢曜扬. I was named after Aaron Copland, one of my dad's favorite composers. 

It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly where I call home. My life timeline as of 2022 is as follows:

* San Jose, California (2001 - 2003)
* Beijing, China (2003-2013)
* Taipei, Taiwan (2013-2015)
* Los Altos, California (2015-2019)
* New York, New York (2019 - present)

For now, I call the Bay Area my home.

I'm a student at NYU studying CS with a particular interest in machine learning and computational neuroscience. I'm also a member of NYU Tandon's honors program, [GLASS](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/glass). 

Outside of studying, I'm a research assistant at a [computational neuroscience lab](http://www.cn3laboratory.org/home.html) at NYU Langone Health under Professor Zhe Sage Chen. In the past, I've participated in an entrepreneurship challenge and worked on applying machine learning models to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy. I was fortunate enough to publish these results in a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.858333/full). Currently, I'm trying to see if we can classify whether a patient has chronic back pain using EEG data as part of my GLASS senior capstone project. 

Besides that, I also had a very undecorated competitive swimming career. I swam for NYU's varsity swim team during my freshman and junior year (COVID cancelled the sophomore season). I liked swimming breaststroke, fly, and IM. 

Oh, and here's my [resume](/photos/Aaron_Hsieh_Resume.pdf).
