Hi there! My name is Aaron. My middle name is Yaoyang, which comes from my Chinese name 謝曜揚. I was named after Aaron Copland, one of my dad's favorite composers. 

I'm a student at NYU studying CS with a particular interest in machine learning and computational neuroscience. I'm also a member of NYU Tandon's honors program, [GLASS](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/glass). 

Outside of studying, I'm a research assistant at a [computational neuroscience lab](http://www.cn3laboratory.org/home.html) at NYU Langone Health under Professor Zhe Sage Chen. In the past, I've participated in an entrepreneurship challenge and worked on applying machine learning models to [Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/sudep/index.htm). I was fortunate enough to publish these results in a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.858333/full). Currently, I'm trying to see if we can classify whether a patient has chronic back pain using EEG data as part of my GLASS senior capstone project. 

For my sophomore summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Meta (it was Facebook back then) on the Instagram Growth Ranking Services team, where I helped add sparse features for notifications ranking. For my junior summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Snap Inc on the Perecption team, where I created an offline testing tool for their ranking framework and iterated on a recommendation source based on visual similarity. During my last week there, I accidentally crashed the service for recommending face lenses for a couple of minutes. Whoops.

Besides that, I also had a very undecorated competitive swimming career. I swam for NYU's varsity swim team during my freshman and junior year (COVID cancelled the sophomore season). I liked swimming breaststroke, fly, and IM. In my free time, I like to hang out with friends, play piano, watch TV/anime, and wasting my time on YouTube.

You might see some blog posts in the category of "Anthropocene-Review". This is taken from a book written by John Green called the [Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55145261-the-anthropocene-reviewed). In brief, John Green gives a review on various topics that define experiences unique to our species, ranging from Mario Kart to the Academic Decathlon. I'm a fan of it, so I've decided to try it too.

Oh, and here's my [resume](https://aaronh314.github.io/assets/Aaron_Hsieh_Resume.pdf).
