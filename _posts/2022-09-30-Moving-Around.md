*My thoughts on moving around a lot as a kid.*

## Nice Wall Deco

For my 21st birthday, two of my friends made paintings of all the cities I've once called home: Beijing, Taipei, Los Altos, and New York. They all have a place in my identity, but they still feel very disconnected from one another. They're like separate worlds, each containing a different version of my life. Hanging all these paintings on one wall somehow makes them feel like they belong together. Maybe I feel a bit more whole? Either way, I'm very thankful for this amazing gift. They're much needed wall deco and a thoughtful tribute to everywhere I've lived in.

## Positives

I like to think that some good came out of my wandering childhood. It taught me how to navigate and adjust to new places/faces relatively quickly. I became a fast learner by necessity, and it's helped me in many parts of life including social settings, classes, and internships. Looking back, I'm also impressed by all the places I've been fortunate enough to live in. As far as I know, not many people get to experience what it's like not growing up in the same house, city, state, or country for all their lives. None of those ever remained constant for me, and I think it's a pretty cool experience to have.

Expanding the number of places I've lived in has paradoxically made my world smaller too. I find myself having random first or second degree connections with others wherever I go. For example, I recently learned that I went to the same middle school in Taipei as my manager's manager's manager at Snap (obviously we weren't in middle school at the same time). It seems really coincidental that I share a thing or two with a wide range of people, but once you realize how much I've been around, it starts to make a little sense.

## Negatives

On the other hand, it did prevent me from developing a sense of security that came from myself. Constantly moving around, I found it a lot quicker and easier to rely on others for that sense of security. I think it partly explains why I tend to struggle with being alone most of the time; I don't feel comfortable without other people around me.

During my junior year of college, I got very little sleep. Junior year consisted of organic chemistry, physics and grad-level machine learning classes on top of 20+ hours of swim practice and research. In spite of my workload, I was still with friends a lot at the expense of my sleep and mental health. I would stay at friends' apartments very late to hangout or help them with homework, only to go back home and sleep for a measely 2 hours before morning practice at 6:30am. I did this for multiple nights in a row. Looking back, I have no idea how I survived, but my insecurities of feeling lonely and not wanted definitely pushed me to my limit. I remember one time after a Saturday morning practice, I fell asleep upright on a couch within 30 seconds of sitting down while someone was talking to me.

It's not the most sustainable way to live, and I'm trying my best to stop neglecting myself for others.

## I Guess it Worked Out?

In spite of all the trouble it's caused me, I'm still eternally grateful for all the people I've met, even if they're not a part of my life anymore. Just for that, I would do it all over again. 

I give moving around every 2 years a 7/10.
